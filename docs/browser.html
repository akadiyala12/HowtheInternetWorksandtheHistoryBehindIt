            <p>The world wide web before mainstream browsers were invented was mainly used by scientists and qualified
                individuals. It was not as easy to use as it is today and did require much more knowledge to use.
                Marc Andreessen along with a few other people decided to try to make the world wide web a more easy to
                use and intuitive tool so that everyone in the world could use it without too much difficulty.
                Andreessen came up with the worlds first graphical web browser called Mosaic that was basic point and
                click.</p>
            <p>In order for Andreessen's creation to progress it needed a large amount of money and this is where Jim
                Clark lent a hand.</p>

            <p>Bill Gates thought that people should pay in order to access this tool.
                Microsoft had left a lot of companies in its trail including even IBM.
                This is where Andreessen and Clark's company stepped in, a company called Netscape. Netscape released
                there new web browser called Navigator. Navigator was and instant success from the second it was
                released.
                Bill Gates then realized that this was the future. He told his company that they would need match and
                beat Netscape.
                Bill Gates and Microsoft made an offer to Netscape stating, they would buy their company for one
                millions dollars and if they didn't accept they would just copy everything Netscape did.
                Andressen made his hate of Microsoft public which was the one cardinal rule, not to insult the giant in
                the industry. He stated that windows would be irrelavent.</p>
            <p>

                Microsoft then came out with their own browser called Internet Explorer. The whole company's focus was
                to drive Netscape out of business.
                Microsoft had a lot of power due to them being an already established company with tons of money to
                spend. On top of that they had the software that these browsers would run on called Windows OS. Slowly
                Internet Explorers market share grew because it was free and bundled with windows OS. Netscape had to
                charge people to use their browser.
                Eventually, Netscape's market share went to single digits and the company was aquired by AOL.
                The US government came down hard on Microsoft stating they used their monopoly of the software market to
                drive Netscape out of business. The court eventually ruled to split the compnay and that order was later
                taken back. Gates later stepped down as CEO of Microsoft.
                Later search engines began to gain popularity. Software companies like Google began to really change the
                way the internet was used.
